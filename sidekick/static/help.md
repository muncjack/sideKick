Welcome to the help
====================

Introduction:
-------------
This help is to help with the basics of markdown. The basic rule is the end of a paragraph is define by a empty return carriage. 


###Â Headers 
The way to do header is very simple.

if you user the ```#``` symbol at the beginning of the line it with a H1 header and it you put two hashes it will be h2 and so on as you can see bellow.

<PRE>#H1</PRE>   
#Header 1

<PRE>##H2</PRE>   
##Header 2

<PRE>###H3</PRE>   
###Header 3

<PRE>##H4</PRE>   
####Header 4

in the case of H1 and H2 there is an alternative as you can see here:
```
Header 1
========
```
Header 1
========

```
Header 2
--------
```
Header 1
--------


###Highlighting
You can highlight a *word* or a **sentence** in bold or italic as like this.
* use ```*``` to start and stop the italics like this:
```
this *word* is in italics
```
this *word* is in italics

* use ```**``` to start and stop the bold like this:
```
this *word* is in italics
```
this **word** is in italics


###Bullet points and number points
basic bullet is achieved by using a '*' or '+' or '-' at beginning of the line followed by a space:
```
+ point
- point 
* point
```
Will give you:
+ point   
- point
* point

If you which to have numbers point just start the line with ```1.```. The nice part is that the numbering will be done automatically so all the following point you can be ```1.``` as well or even ```*-+```, here is an example:
```
1. first entry
1. second point 
1. treerd point
```
1. first entry
1. second point 
1. treerd point

###Indentation 
If you which to indent some text use the ```>```, like email reply encapsulate the original email, you can use multiple chevrons to indent more: 
```
> Some indent text.
>> Some more test that is indent.
```
> Some indent text.
>> Some more test that is indent.

###Code or shell formatting:
The output from a terminal of code can be displayed without any formatting by using <CODE>```</CODE> at the beginning and the end off the section in some cases you may end up ussing the the html tag code in the case you empty line feed.
